      Defines a constant that is set in the source package props.
      Consumers of this source package will respect this property.
      
      This allows us to mark clasp source as generated only when
      it is included by the source package to ensure no analyzer
      diagnostics are emitted.  However, Roslyn consumers do not
      set this flag to report issues during Roslyn build.
      
      Works around an issue where there is no way for consumers
      of a source package to ignore warnings in the package source.
